<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>

<p> Hi! My name is Yashas Kumar. I am currently working towards a BS in Computer Science (with an intended minor in Computational Finance) at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_School_of_Computer_Science" target="_new">Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science</a>.</p>
<p>I grew up in the Silicon Valley and graduated from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_San_Jose_High_School" target="_new">Mission San Jose High School</a>, where I founded the Make-A-Wish Club, participated in science competitions (like the <a href="http://siemens.collegeboard.org/" target="_new">Siemens Competition</a>), and helped lead the debate team.</p> 
<p>I've previously worked at <a href="http://nanocad.ee.ucla.edu/" target="_new">UCLA's NanoCAD Lab</a> and at <a href="http://www.ml.cmu.edu/" target="_new">CMU's Machine Learning Department</a>. As of Summer 2013, I'm interning on the Data Services team at <a href="http://www.banno.com" target="_new">Banno</a> and working on a few cool tech projects in my spare time.</p>
<p>Here are some computer science courses that I have taken at Carnegie Mellon since Fall 2012, my first semester:</p>
